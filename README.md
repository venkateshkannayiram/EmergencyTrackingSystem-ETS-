# what is location-based service(LBS)?
A location-based service (LBS) is a software service for mobile device applications that requires knowledge about where the mobile device is geographically located. The application collects geodata, which is data gathered in real time using one or more location tracking technologies.

Location-based services integrate data from various resources, including Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, cellular tower pings and short-range positioning beacons, to provide services based on the user's geographical location. Although location-based technologies have been commercially available for almost two decades, the applications and services that use geodata have recently become mainstream.
